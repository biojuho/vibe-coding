## 2026-04-04 | Codex | blind-to-x warning cleanup for models/observability

### Work Summary

Finished the follow-up that remained after the focused scale-module tests started passing: warning cleanup in the touched runtime code itself.

1. Updated `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/models.py` from Pydantic v1 `@validator(..., pre=True)` to Pydantic v2 `@field_validator(..., mode="before")`, which removes the `PydanticDeprecatedSince20` warning from the focused suites.
2. Updated `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/observability.py::_is_async()` to use `inspect.iscoroutinefunction` instead of `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction`, which removes the Python 3.14+ deprecation warning from the observability tests.
3. Re-ran the focused test sets and confirmed they now pass cleanly without the earlier warnings.

### Changed Files

## 2026-04-04 | Codex | blind-to-x db_backend coverage + observability validation

### Work Summary

Continued the same `blind-to-x` test-hardening session by closing the remaining module gap after the queue/PG backend tests.

1. Found an existing local WIP file, `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_observability_and_task_queue.py`, and verified it already gives broad `observability.py` coverage plus overlapping queue coverage (`48 passed`), so I avoided creating a second duplicate observability test suite.
2. Added `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_db_backend.py` to cover `RedisCacheBackend` JSON/raw handling, scan-based clearing, `DistributedRateLimiter` script/fail-open logic, `DistributedLock` acquire/release, and the Redis-backed factory fallbacks using stub Redis clients instead of live infrastructure.
3. Confirmed the next follow-up is no longer missing test coverage but warning cleanup: `pipeline.models` still emits the known Pydantic V1 `@validator` warning, and `pipeline.observability._is_async()` emits a deprecation warning because it still uses `asyncio.iscoroutinefunction`.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_db_backend.py` | Added stubbed Redis/cache/rate-limit/lock/factory coverage |
| `.ai/HANDOFF.md` | Updated the relay with the remaining scale-module coverage and warning follow-up |

- `venv\Scripts\python.exe -X utf8 -m pytest projects\blind-to-x\tests\unit\test_observability_and_task_queue.py -q --tb=short -o addopts=` -> **48 passed**
- The observability suite currently emits the existing `pipeline.models` Pydantic warning plus a deprecation warning from `pipeline.observability._is_async()`.

## 2026-04-04 | Codex | blind-to-x focused queue/PG test coverage

### Work Summary

Added targeted `pytest` coverage for two of the newest and riskiest `blind-to-x` scale modules without requiring live Redis or PostgreSQL services.

1. Added `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_task_queue.py` to verify `LocalSemaphoreQueue` preserves input order, reports progress, converts worker failures to `None`, falls back from Celery to local execution for non-task workers, and returns a cached local singleton when Celery boot fails.
2. Added `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_cost_db_pg.py` to verify `PostgresCostDatabase.record_draft()` update/insert branching, `get_today_summary()` aggregation and zero fallback behavior, and `get_circuit_skip_hours()` threshold mapping using stubbed connection objects instead of a live PostgreSQL dependency.
3. Updated the shared AI context so the next session knows `task_queue.py` and `cost_db_pg.py` are now covered and `T-130` should focus on the remaining modules such as `observability.py` and `db_backend.py`.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_task_queue.py` | Added focused async queue tests for ordering, progress, failure handling, and Celery fallback |
| `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_cost_db_pg.py` | Added stubbed PostgreSQL backend tests for summary, branching, and backoff logic |
| `.ai/HANDOFF.md` | Recorded the new blind-to-x coverage and remaining T-130 scope |
| `.ai/TASKS.md` | Added `T-137` and narrowed `T-130` to the remaining new modules |
| `.ai/CONTEXT.md` | Added the new blind-to-x queue/PG test coverage notes |
| `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md` | Logged this testing session |

### Verification Results

- `venv\Scripts\python.exe -X utf8 -m pytest projects\blind-to-x\tests\unit\test_task_queue.py -q --tb=short -o addopts=` -> **4 passed**
- `venv\Scripts\python.exe -X utf8 -m pytest projects\blind-to-x\tests\unit\test_cost_db_pg.py -q --tb=short -o addopts=` -> **10 passed**
- Both runs emitted the existing non-blocking Pydantic V1 `@validator` deprecation warning from `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/models.py`.

## 2026-04-03 | Codex | system QC review

### Work Summary

Ran the shared operator ladder to re-check current workspace health without changing product code.

1. Verified `workspace/scripts/doctor.py` still passes.
2. Ran `workspace/scripts/quality_gate.py` and confirmed the shared root gate is broken again by a concentrated `workspace/tests/test_scheduler_engine.py` failure cluster.
3. Ran `workspace/execution/qaqc_runner.py` and recorded the current shared result as `REJECTED` (`2471 passed / 46 failed / 1 errors / 1 skipped`).
4. Reproduced the main blocking regressions with targeted pytest runs:
   - `workspace/execution/scheduler_engine.py` async API drift plus `_DB_INITIALIZED` cross-db caching.
   - `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/process_stages/fetch_stage.py` scraper compatibility regression.
   - `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/draft_prompts.py` `newsletter_block` initialization bug.
5. Confirmed a QC-tooling problem in `workspace/execution/qaqc_runner.py`: when launched from `projects/blind-to-x` with absolute test paths, pytest can exit `0` with no collected output on this Windows setup, so blind-to-x is currently under-exercised by the DEEP runner.
6. Updated shared AI context files and added follow-up tasks `T-133`, `T-134`, and `T-135`.

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | T-129 cache/queue/read-model foundations

### Work Summary

Extended `T-129` from design-only state into runnable scale-hardening foundations inside `projects/hanwoo-dashboard`.

1. Installed `bullmq` and `ioredis`, then added `src/lib/redis.js` and `src/lib/queue.js` for cache-vs-queue Redis connection management, named BullMQ queues, and default retry/backoff settings.
2. Added Prisma read-model/outbox declarations: `OutboxStatus`, `OutboxEvent`, `DashboardSnapshot`, `NotificationSummary`, and `MarketPriceSnapshot`.
3. Added SQL drafts under `prisma/manual/` for both concurrent index backfill and the new outbox/read-model tables.
4. Added `src/lib/dashboard/cache.js`, `src/lib/dashboard/events.js`, and `src/lib/dashboard/read-models.js` so future routes/actions can use cache keys, outbox helpers, and cached read-model persistence instead of raw full-table access patterns.
5. Verified the new foundation code with `npm run db:generate`, `npx prisma validate`, targeted `npx eslint` on the new helper files, and direct Node imports for the Redis/BullMQ helper surfaces.
6. Confirmed the live DB blocker still exists: `npm run db:verify-indexes -- --skip-explain` exits early because `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/.env` still contains the placeholder pooled Postgres password.

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | T-129 DB audit tooling bootstrap

### Work Summary

Turned the first implementation step of `T-129` into runnable project-local tooling for `projects/hanwoo-dashboard`.

1. Added `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/scripts/verify-db-indexes.mjs` to inventory live indexes through the existing Prisma stack, compare them against both schema-declared expectations and the proposed scale-hardening index set, print missing `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` statements, and run targeted `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` probes.
2. Added `npm run db:verify-indexes` to `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/package.json`, using Node's type-stripping path so the generated Prisma client can be reused without adding new dependencies.
3. Added `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/prisma/manual/2026-04-02_scale_index_backfill.sql` as the first-pass concurrent-index backfill draft for the live DB verification phase.
4. Updated the design doc so Day 1 now points directly at the new script and manual SQL draft.
5. Verified the new script's guard path: it exits early with a clear message because `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/.env` still contains the Supabase placeholder password instead of a real pooled `DATABASE_URL`.

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | T-129 design package

### Work Summary

Converted the earlier scale review into an implementation-ready design package for `projects/hanwoo-dashboard`.

1. Created `docs/designs/2026-04-02-hanwoo-dashboard-scale-hardening-design.md`.
2. Documented the chosen architecture: Redis cache, BullMQ worker, read models, paginated dashboard APIs, and route-level client splitting.
3. Added concrete Redis keys, invalidation rules, queue job types, Prisma model draft, SQL index draft, and a day-by-day week-1 rollout.
4. Moved `T-129` into `IN_PROGRESS` with the next step clearly defined as live index verification plus migration drafting.

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | 100x scale architecture review

### Work Summary

Reviewed the current traffic-bearing dashboard paths with a scale-up lens, focusing on `projects/hanwoo-dashboard` and the read-heavy `projects/knowledge-dashboard`.

1. Identified the main DB/read bottleneck: `hanwoo-dashboard` still performs broad dashboard reads on every dynamic page request and several server actions still load whole tables or aggregate in application code.
2. Identified the main backend bottleneck: most mutations still fan out through synchronous request paths plus broad `revalidatePath('/')` invalidation instead of queue-backed side-effect isolation or read-model refreshes.
3. Identified the main frontend bottleneck: `DashboardClient` remains a monolithic client boundary that imports all tabs/widgets, recomputes large collections in render, and triggers expensive `router.refresh()` reloads after most writes.
4. Verified build output to support the frontend concern: post-build chunk inspection showed a largest emitted JS chunk of about `868 KB` in `hanwoo-dashboard` and about `516 KB` in `knowledge-dashboard`.
5. Added follow-up task `T-129` so the scale-hardening work is visible in the shared backlog.

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | knowledge-dashboard signed-session auth hardening

### Work Summary

Production-hardened `projects/knowledge-dashboard` after the Pro analytics upgrade.

1. Added `src/lib/dashboard-auth.ts` so the internal data routes can share a signed `httpOnly` session model instead of relying on a raw browser-stored API key.
2. Added `src/app/api/auth/session/route.ts` to create, clear, and inspect dashboard auth sessions.
3. Updated `src/app/page.tsx` so it authenticates through the session route, validates dashboard payload shapes before state updates, and keeps QA/QC failures non-fatal while distinguishing auth failures from generic load failures.
4. Added node tests for `src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` and updated `scripts/smoke.mjs` so smoke coverage now proves the session-cookie flow end to end.

### Work Summary

Hardened `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` array and object references to prevent crashes and stop `useMemo` from constantly recalculating values on falsy defaults.
Executed a complete QA/QC lifecycle validation confirming that malicious input or null state will not crash the component.

1. Expanded `query` prop-type to `string | string[] | null` to account for raw Next.js router payloads natively in the component tree.
2. Verified `Array.isArray()` inside the component so falsy bounds or object bugs evaluate gracefully into empty constants.
3. Created `EMPTY_GITHUB_DATA` and `EMPTY_NOTEBOOK_DATA` constant bindings so `useMemo` compares references identically vs creating brand new `[]` arrays every single React render pass.
4. Capped high-volume rendering loads with `notebookData.slice(0, 50)` down-sampling logic for performance limits matching Recharts boundaries.
5. Successfully ran Phase 1 -> Phase 4 full regression testing validation (`/qa-qc` pipeline).

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | knowledge-dashboard analytics QC hardening

### Work Summary

Closed the two highest-risk QC findings in the upgraded analytics flow.

1. Hardened `src/app/page.tsx` so authenticated route responses are shape-validated before `setData`, QA/QC payload failures are non-fatal, non-auth data-load failures render a dedicated retry state instead of crashing later in render, and the dashboard bearer key is no longer persisted in `localStorage`.
2. Updated `src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` so large `Unspecified` language buckets are treated as metadata-quality gaps rather than a real dominant stack, which avoids misleading concentration badges and recommendations.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/app/page.tsx` | Added payload validation and non-auth load-error handling |
| `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` | Reframed `Unspecified` language-heavy slices as metadata gaps |
| `.ai/HANDOFF.md`, `.ai/CONTEXT.md`, `.ai/STATUS.md` | Synced the QC hardening state |

### Verification Results

- `npm run lint` (`projects/knowledge-dashboard`) -> **pass**
- `npm run build` (`projects/knowledge-dashboard`) -> **pass**

## 2026-04-02 | Antigravity | knowledge-dashboard Pro-level Visualization & QA/QC

### Work Summary

Fully upgraded `projects/knowledge-dashboard` chart rendering with pro-grade UX standards and executed full QA/QC checks on the newly introduced insights engine.

1. Enhanced `src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` with dynamic Glassmorphism custom tooltips, SVG hover interactions, and Tailwind v4 CSS classes.
2. Made Pie chart grouping robust by aggregating any languages beyond top-5 into an 'Others' category so the visualization accurately represents 100% of the dataset.
3. Added elegant zero-data and empty-state placeholder cards.
4. Cleaned up React bindings and resolved TypeScript `activeIndex` typings mismatch in Recharts.
5. Successfully ran the full `/qa-qc` pipeline validating math division-by-zero checks (`NaN` prevention), null-data safety, component resilience, and ensuring zero TS/Lint warnings.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` | Pro-level UX chart upgrades, robust long-tail logic, empty state handling |

### Verification Results

- `npx tsc --noEmit` (`projects/knowledge-dashboard`) -> **pass** (0 errors)
- `/qa-qc` Report -> **APPROVED** (Phase 2, 3, 4 completed successfully)

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | knowledge-dashboard analytics action playbook

### Work Summary

Pushed the same analytics upgrade one step further so the dashboard now recommends what to do next instead of only visualizing the current state.

1. Expanded `src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` to derive a weighted health score plus recommended actions from diversity, concentration, coverage, and source-depth signals.
2. Rebuilt `src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` around that richer model so the page now shows KPI cards, recommendation playbooks, and more resilient empty states in one flow.
3. Kept the search-aware analytics path intact so the recommendations stay aligned with the currently visible slice rather than the full dataset.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` | Added health scoring and recommendation generation |
| `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` | Added action playbook UI on top of the chart analytics |
| `.ai/HANDOFF.md`, `.ai/CONTEXT.md`, `.ai/STATUS.md` | Synced the new dashboard recommendation state |

### Verification Results

- `npm run lint` (`projects/knowledge-dashboard`) -> **pass**
- `npm run build` (`projects/knowledge-dashboard`) -> **pass**

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | knowledge-dashboard analytics insight engine

### Work Summary

Upgraded `projects/knowledge-dashboard` charting and analytics toward a more Pro-grade dashboard UX.

1. Added `src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` to centralize language bucketing, diversity scoring, dominant-stack share, notebook coverage, median source depth, and badge generation.
2. Rebuilt `src/components/DashboardCharts.tsx` so the charts consume derived insight data instead of doing inline one-off transforms in the view.
3. Updated `src/app/page.tsx` so analytics now respond to deferred filtered results, which keeps search interactions smoother and keeps the charts aligned with the visible list.
4. Added richer empty states and explanatory insight badges so sparse datasets, missing languages, zero-source notebooks, and search-only slices are easier to interpret.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/knowledge-dashboard/src/lib/dashboard-insights.ts` | Added shared dashboard insight engine |

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | T-124 frontend runtime smoke coverage

### Work Summary

Closed `T-124` by wiring runtime smoke checks directly into the frontend app matrix.

1. Added `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/scripts/smoke.mjs` to boot the built app and verify login-page reachability, protected-route redirects, and unauthenticated payment API rejection.
2. Added `projects/knowledge-dashboard/scripts/smoke.mjs` to boot the built app and verify the API-key gate plus authenticated internal data route access.
3. Added `npm run smoke` scripts to both frontend package manifests.
4. Updated `.github/workflows/full-test-matrix.yml` so the frontend matrix now runs a runtime smoke step after build and lint.
5. Kept the parallel untracked `workspace/tests/test_frontends.py` path untouched because it appears to be adjacent WIP from another tool.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/package.json` | Added `smoke` script |

## 2026-04-02 | Antigravity | T-124 Frontend smoke coverage

### Work Summary

Closed `T-124` by adding basic integration tests in `workspace/tests/test_frontends.py`.

1. Confirmed both `knowledge-dashboard` and `hanwoo-dashboard` dev servers can be booted using `npx next dev` during Pytest fixture setup.
2. Verified that Next.js boot errors are caught properly and that the servers return valid HTTP responses using urllib assertions. 
3. Fixed NextAuth URL redirects and Windows subprocess process-group hanging bugs (`CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`) that stalled test completion.
4. Validated the testing logic reliably asserts 200 OK responses on unprotected routes without needing DB connections.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `workspace/tests/test_frontends.py` | Added test fixtures and smoke tests for both frontends |
| `.ai/TASKS.md` | Marked T-124 as completed |

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | T-123 knowledge-dashboard internal data delivery

### Work Summary

Closed `T-123` in `projects/knowledge-dashboard`.

1. Removed the stale public JSON delivery path in favor of authenticated route handlers under `src/app/api/data/*`.
2. Updated `scripts/sync_data.py` to use repo-relative paths for `data/`, `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md`, and shared QA/QC history helpers.
3. Added `/data/*.json` to the project `.gitignore` so internal dashboard payloads stay out of source control.
4. Refreshed the project README to document the internal `data/` flow and bearer-key access model.
5. Fixed the dashboard page's React effect-state lint issues so the project validates cleanly again.

### Changed Files

## 2026-04-01 | Codex | T-122 hanwoo-dashboard auth and payment hardening

### Work Summary

Hardened `projects/hanwoo-dashboard` so auth and payment ownership are enforced on real server boundaries instead of weaker client or cookie-presence checks.

---

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | hanwoo-dashboard vibe-coding architecture audit

### Work Summary

Reviewed `projects/hanwoo-dashboard` for structural defects and hallucination-style drift.

1. Verified the live app still builds and lints, which ruled out an immediate broken-import / nonexistent-library failure mode.
2. Confirmed the main coupling hotspot is the `src/app/page.js` -> `src/lib/actions.js` -> `src/components/DashboardClient.js` flow, with duplicate widget fetches and repeated `router.refresh()` / `revalidatePath('/')`.
3. Cross-checked current official docs and noted that `src/proxy.js` is aligned with the current Next.js 16 Proxy/Auth.js shape, while the manual Google font `<link>` tags should move to `next/font`.
4. Logged review-driven follow-up `T-132` for the stale README stack docs and the `npm audit`-reported `lodash@4.17.23` path via `recharts`.

### Changed Files

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `.ai/HANDOFF.md` | Added the latest hanwoo-dashboard architecture-audit findings and verification notes |
| `.ai/TASKS.md` | Added follow-up task `T-132` for review-driven cleanup |
| `.ai/CONTEXT.md` | Recorded the verified coupling, doc-drift, and dependency-risk notes |

### Verification Results

## 2026-04-02 | Codex | T-132 hanwoo-dashboard review-driven cleanup

### Work Summary

Closed `T-132` in `projects/hanwoo-dashboard`.

1. Batched the dashboard page's initial reads with `Promise.all` and passed initial market-price data into the client shell.
2. Added `src/lib/notifications.js` so alert notifications are derived from the live cattle list instead of a second client-side fetch, and updated the notification widget/modal surfaces to consume those derived records.
3. Updated `MarketPriceWidget` and `SalesTab` so the market widget reuses server-provided data on first render instead of immediately refetching.
4. Replaced manual Google font `<link>` tags with `next/font`, aligned the README stack docs with the live Next.js 16/Postgres/Auth.js setup, and bumped the `lodash` override so `npm audit --omit=dev` is now clean.

## 2026-04-03 | Codex | T-133/T-134/T-135 follow-through + T-136 blind-to-x image prompt repair

### Work Summary

Closed the 2026-04-03 QC regressions that were blocking the root scheduler path and the `blind-to-x` DEEP run.

1. Restored `workspace/execution/scheduler_engine.py` sync compatibility for `run_task()`, `run_due_tasks()`, and `_execute_subprocess()`, and removed the stale DB-init memoization that skipped schema setup after `DB_PATH` changes.
2. Updated `workspace/execution/scheduler_worker.py` to call the restored sync scheduler API directly.
3. Fixed `workspace/execution/qaqc_runner.py` so project-local pytest runs can convert test paths to `cwd`-relative paths on Windows.
4. Fixed `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/process_stages/fetch_stage.py` to fall back to `scrape_post()` when `scrape_post_with_retry()` is unavailable.
5. Fixed `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/draft_prompts.py` so `newsletter_block` is initialized even when `newsletter` output is not requested.
6. Restored generic topic scenes in `projects/blind-to-x/pipeline/image_generator.py`, which cleared the final DEEP integration failure and produced an `APPROVED` project-only QC result for `blind-to-x`.
