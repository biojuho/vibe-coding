| Work | **T-479 completed**: Hanwoo sales form saves now wait for the async sale creation handler before re-enabling actions. `SalesTab` tracks `isSaving`, guards the add/cancel toggle while saving, awaits `onCreateSale`, disables the add/cancel and submit controls while saving, and exposes `aria-busy` on the submit button so slow network saves cannot trigger duplicate sales submissions. `home-market-copy.test.mjs` guards the contract.

Before this pass, any scene with `audio_ok=True` retried as `component="visual"`, so duration/CPS/audio-volume failures reused the same old audio checkpoint and could waste retries without addressing the failing check. `PipelineOrchestrator` now derives the retry component from failed QC checks: audio integrity/timing/volume routes to `audio` or `both`, visual failures route to `visual`, and script-only failures skip media retry and remain surfaced as unresolved. Retry counts now reflect actual regeneration attempts. |

| Work | **T-333 completed**: continued the active Hanwoo product-completeness goal by localizing the admin diagnostics surface. `DiagnosticsPageClient` now uses Korean operations copy for loading, errors, status cards, database ledger, raw-data inspector, model selector labels, and dashboard return action instead of English placeholders like `System Diagnostics`, `Database Status`, `Loading records.`, and `Please try again in a moment.` Commit `c0113d9`. |

| Work | **T-331 completed**: continued T-318 for `shorts-maker-v2` and fixed the Gate 4 file-size boundary that held otherwise valid Shorts renders at 50.4MB. `QCStep.gate4_final` now uses named final-size policy bounds `[2,60]MB` instead of a hard-coded 50MB ceiling, aligning QC with the existing standard/premium renderer bitrate caps while still holding oversized files.

| Work | **T-327 completed**: continued the "프로젝트 하나 디버깅" goal by selecting the safe `shorts-maker-v2` Phase 3 hook-score issue from T-318. Root cause: `PipelineOrchestrator` calculated `manifest.hook_score` but weak hooks only emitted `hook_score_weak` warnings, so Gate 4 PASS could still mark the job `success`. Added a retryable non-blocking `hook_score` degraded step whenever `score_hook(...).passed` is false, so weak-hook renders no longer enter the upload-ready success path. Full-suite verification exposed two weak test fixtures; preserved the stricter gate by updating fixture hook narration, and extended `hook_scorer` with narrow English contrast/tech specificity support for valid hooks like `Tiny chips, big savings`. |

| Work | **T-325 완료** + 미푸시 12커밋 push. 활성 goal(`hanwoo-dashboard` 제품완성형) 진행: App Router에 `error.js`/`not-found.js`/`global-error.js`가 전무해 런타임 에러·잘못된 URL이 Next.js 기본 디버그 화면으로 노출되던 갭을 해소. 로그인 디자인 토큰을 재사용한 브랜디드 상태 페이지 3종(404 서버 컴포넌트 / route error 클라이언트 boundary, retry=`reset()` / global-error 루트 레이아웃 boundary, 인라인 스타일) + `globals.css` `Status Pages` 블록(44줄) + empty-state 패턴 본뜬 source-wiring 테스트. 검증: `npm test` 84 passed/0 fail, `npm run lint` pass, `npm run build` pass(`/_not-found` 정적 프리렌더 확인). commit `c00712d`. 세션 시작 시 `session_orient`로 origin 대비 ahead 12 확인 → 사용자 승인 후 `git push`(`7962830..85b5d31`). |
| Next Priorities | **경합 주의(중요)**: 병렬 도구와 동시 git 작업 시 공유 인덱스 경합이 두 번 발생. (1) 첫 commit `b56592e`가 빈 커밋이 됨(`git apply --cached`와 `git commit` 사이 인덱스 클리어, "PASS (no staged files)"가 단서) → `c00712d`로 재커밋. (2) `[ai-context]` 커밋 `a5fa474`는 의도한 `.ai/*` 4파일 외에 **Codex의 T-326 Farm Setup 피처 코드**(`setup-progress.mjs`/`.test.mjs`, `DashboardClient.js`, `globals.css` setup-progress 블록 168줄)도 함께 담김 — Codex의 `git add`가 내 `git add`↔`git commit` 사이에 끼어듦. **결과적으로 Codex의 T-326 orphan WIP가 `a5fa474`에 정상 커밋됨**(해당 코드는 Codex가 `npm test 84 passed`+build로 이미 검증). 교훈: 부분 커밋은 `git commit -- <pathspec>` 형태(인덱스 무시, 워킹트리에서 해당 경로만)를 쓰면 경합 면역. `b56592e` 빈 커밋은 rebase 위험으로 그대로 둠. hanwoo goal은 계속 진행 중, T-251은 여전히 외부/사용자 소유 차단. |

CI(`full-test-matrix.yml`의 `blind-to-x-tests` 잡)는 동일 unit+integration 커맨드를 main push/PR마다 실행 — 워크스페이스 pnpm WIP diff는 `node-apps` 잡만 수정하고 `blind-to-x-tests`(Python) 잡 무손상 확인. **갭 보완**: `.env.example`이 README "관측성" 섹션이 문서화한 토글 3개(`OPENAI_IMAGE_ENABLED`, `LANGFUSE_ENABLED`, `BTX_USAGE_FORWARD`)를 누락 → 주석과 함께 추가(+5줄). 문서는 이미 충실(README 257 + ops-runbook 204 + operations_sop 97 + notion_view_setup_guide 137 + external-review/). |

Added `src/lib/dashboard/setup-progress.mjs` + tests and rendered a home-screen Farm Setup / 운영 준비도 panel in `DashboardClient.js`. The panel tracks 농장 기본 정보, 축사 구조, 개체 등록, 재고 기준, and 첫 일정, shows progress, and routes incomplete items directly to Settings, cattle add, Inventory, or Schedule. Also corrected the home empty 축사 CTA so it opens Settings instead of the cattle modal. |

Active Hanwoo goal remains open; T-251 is still external/user-owned Supabase credential resync. Preserve unrelated dirty WIP in root package/workflow files, package locks for other projects, `setup.bat`, and the pre-existing Hanwoo `package.json` postinstall removal. Note: `globals.css` already contained unrelated status-page styles before/alongside this pass, so review hunks before staging. |

## Notes

- **T-251 (active blocker)**: Supabase database password desynchronization. User must reset password via Supabase Dashboard (Project Settings > Database), then update `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/.env`.
- **Origin sync**: As of 2026-05-19, `main` is synchronized with `origin/main` and the worktree is clean.
- Older addenda archived in `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-05-15.md` and `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-05-19.md`.
