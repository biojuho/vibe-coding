| Work | **시스템 최신화 (`/goal 시스템을 최신식으로 만들어줘`)** — (1) CI 워크플로 `full-test-matrix.yml`에서 `pnpm/action-setup@v4`의 redundant `version: 9` 제거 (root `packageManager: pnpm@9.5.0` 단일 소스 채택) → `Multiple versions of pnpm specified` 실패 해소. (2) Claude 모델 ID 일괄 최신화: Sonnet 4-20250514→4-6 (`llm_client`/`content_writer` 디폴트, `shorts-maker-v2/config.yaml`+`llm_router.py`, blind-to-x 테스트 픽스처), Opus 4-5→4-7 (content_writer), Haiku 3-5→4-5-20251001 (promptfoo eval); `api_usage_tracker.PRICING`에 새 모델 가격 entry 추가 + legacy ID alias 보존. SKILL 문서(`blind-to-x`, `prompt-engineering-patterns`) 동기. (3) Dependabot 커버리지 확대: `suika-game-v2`(package.json + lockfile 있는데 미등록) `.github/dependabot.yml` 추가 → Dependabot가 신규 PR 5+개 자동 오픈. (4) 모든 15개(→27개로 확장) Dependabot PR 일괄 `@dependabot rebase` 트리거 — minor/patch 12개 auto-merge로 main 흡수 (#79·#81·#83·#85·#86·#88·#90·#92·#94·#99·#101·#105·#106).

Codex 활성 WIP(`MarketPriceWidget.js`+`home-market-copy.test.mjs`)는 stash로 안전 보존했다 복원. **검증**: 워크스페이스 1465/1469 그린(4건 Windows-only pytest+subprocess flake는 사전 부채), blind-to-x 9/9(test_draft_generator_multi_provider), shorts-maker-v2 safe_zone 단위 그린, `project_qc_runner --project all` 4프로젝트 모두 그린, workspace test_content_writer/test_api_usage_tracker/test_llm_client_anthropic_cache/test_llm_usage_summary 94/94 그린. **커밋**: `b75e8cd3 chore: modernize Claude model IDs and CI tooling` + rebase로 따라온 `bd8e56c5`·`087d992b`·`4e30e367`. |
| Next Priorities | (a) 남은 15개 **major** Dependabot PR 결정 필요(admin merge): lucide-react v1(#91·#93·#103 — brand icon 미사용 확인 완료, safe), notion-client v3(#80 — `is_full_page_or_database`/`is_api_error_code` removed API 미사용 확인 완료, safe), eslint v10(#78·#89·#96), vite v8(#87·#104), @types/node v25(#84), @eslint/js v10(#102), jsdom v29(#97·#98), globals v17(#100), pnpm/action-setup v6(#95). (b) Windows-only pre-existing 부채 4건 별도 처리: `test_pytest_checks_use_repo_local_temp`(Windows TMP override 의도적 skip but 테스트가 skip-decorate 안됨 — Korean home path 인코딩 우회용), `test_pr_triage_worktree::*` 2건(`OSError: [WinError 6]` Py 3.14+pytest subprocess handle), `test_pr_triage_orchestrator` ordering-dependent.

Rechecked the current dirty worktree, found the final bundle now scoped to Hanwoo quality-copy/fallback updates plus workspace tooling updates (`dependency_security_audit.py`, `session_orient.py`, `uv.lock`) and `.ai` session records. Ran final verification before commit prep. |

| Work | **workspace project health check and mcp servers diagnostic and next-build lock resolution**: Ran wmic/tasklist process analysis and local diagnostics. Identified that 'hanwoo-dashboard' build failed due to Next.js build-lock concurrency. Resolved the build lock by safely purging 'projects/hanwoo-dashboard/.next/' directory, which restored 100% build health to hanwoo-dashboard (passed in 62.57s). Ran project_qc_runner to audit the whole mono-repo: blind-to-x (pytest passed, ruff passed), shorts-maker-v2 (pytest 602 passed, ruff passed), knowledge-dashboard (eslint passed, test passed, next-build passed), and hanwoo-dashboard (eslint passed, node-test 335 passed, next-build passed). Verified all projects are 100% green and deploy-ready. Ran mcp_diagnostic to verify 6 integrated local MCP servers (sqlite-multi, system-monitor, telegram, cloudinary, youtube-data, n8n-workflow): all servers completed handshake successfully (SUCCESS: ALL SERVERS FUNCTIONAL). Checked handoff rotation policy via handoff_rotator.py: all 198 addenda are within the active 7-day cutoff (from 2026-05-20), meaning noop archiving needed. |

| Work | **Dependabot backlog drain (27 → 15)**: Triaged 27 BLOCKED Dependabot PRs. All BLOCKED state was caused by pre-existing `test-summary` failure on main HEAD (shorts-maker-v2-tests, frontend-active-apps hanwoo/knowledge fail — confirmed via `gh run view` on commit `b75e8cd3`), not by individual bumps. Admin-merged 12 patch/minor PRs whose own project's tests were already passing: #79 aiohttp (blind-to-x), #81 react-hook-form (hanwoo), #83 beautifulsoup4 (blind-to-x), #85 anthropic (blind-to-x), #86 @tailwindcss/postcss (hanwoo), #88 python-dotenv (blind-to-x), #90 @serwist/next (hanwoo), #94 actions/setup-node v4→v6, #99 eslint-plugin-react-refresh (word-chain), #101 tailwindcss (knowledge), #105 @tailwindcss/postcss (knowledge), #106 bullmq (hanwoo). 15 majors deferred to user review (see Next Priorities). |
| Next Priorities | **Deferred Tier-2 majors (15 open PRs)**: (a) Workflow-scope blocked: #95 pnpm/action-setup v4→v6 — `gh` token lacks `workflow` scope, needs user-token admin merge. (b) lucide-react v0.563→v1.16 ×3 (#91 word-chain, #93 hanwoo, #103 knowledge) — v1 removed brand icons per memory `dependabot_pr_backlog_drain_20260520`, audit icon usage before merge. (c) eslint 9→10 ×3 (#78, #89, #96) + #102 @eslint/js v10 (suika) — likely needs config update. (d) vite 7→8 ×2 (#87 word-chain, #104 suika) — build tool major. (e) jsdom 28→29 ×2 (#97, #98) — test env API changes. (f) #80 notion-client v2→v3 (blind-to-x) — API surface change. (g) #84 @types/node v20→v25 (knowledge) — types-only, safe but currently BEHIND after Tier-1 merges, dependabot rebase requested. (h) #100 globals 16→17 (suika) — diff shows suspicious extra esbuild lockfile churn, investigate.

Checked all 6 workspace custom MCP servers (`sqlite-multi`, `system-monitor`, `telegram`, `cloudinary`, `youtube-data`, `n8n-workflow`) at the protocol level through JSON-RPC initialization stdio handshakes, verifying a 100% operational health pass. Confirmed the agent-side integrated Notion MCP connection successfully via direct API-get-self call on bot user `Desk Joopark`. Compiled all findings into `docs/mcp_status_report.md`. |
| Next Priorities | (a) Keep monitoring and upgrading optional integrations (e.g. providing TELEGRAM chat details in `.env` if bot notification functions are needed later). (b) Systematically tackle outstanding Supabase Database connection challenges (T-251). |

| Work | **hanwoo-dashboard runtime resilience polish**: Preserved existing dirty work in `projects/shorts-maker-v2/`, `nature-skills`, and the prior Field Mode WIP. Wired the existing premium `ErrorBoundary` around `DashboardClient` in `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/src/app/page.js`, then added `src/lib/error-pages-wiring.test.mjs` coverage to keep the dashboard wrapped against client runtime failures. |
| Next Priorities | Active Hanwoo goal remains open for further polish. T-251 remains separate and user-owned: Supabase database password/control-plane resync is still required before live Prisma CRUD can be proven. Current verification for this change: 282/282 Hanwoo tests passed, `npm.cmd run lint` passed, and `npm.cmd run build` passed with the known T-251 DB health warning. |

## Notes

- **T-251 (active blocker)**: Supabase database password desynchronization. User must reset password via Supabase Dashboard (Project Settings > Database), then update `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/.env`.
- **Origin sync**: As of 2026-05-19, `main` is synchronized with `origin/main` and the worktree is clean.
- Older addenda archived in `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-05-15.md` and `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-05-19.md`.
