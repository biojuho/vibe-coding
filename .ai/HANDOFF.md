| Work | **자율 품질 루프 — 5 commits (context resumed from prior session)**: (1) BTX-FC001 `feed_collector.py` NaN/Inf editorial score guard (`math.isfinite`) + `", ".join()` type-safety (`str(r)`) + 1 regression test; (2) BTX-DP001 `draft_prompts.py` missing score sentinel `"N/A"` instead of `0` so LLM prompt shows "not scored" vs "scored 0" — 3 test updates; (3) SMV2-SS001 `script_step.py` return type hint corrected to 4-tuple (including `cta_violations`); (4) BTX-PC001 `process.py` None url slice guard + `failure_stage` accuracy (hardcoded "upload" → `_current_running_stage(ctx)`); (5) HW-SY001 `system.js` optional chaining `error?.message` in catch block. All touched tests green (330 blind-to-x, 85 shorts-maker-v2). |
| Next Priorities | (a) **user action required**: `git push origin main` (many commits ahead); (b) Continue quality sweep: `shorts-maker-v2/pipeline/tts_step.py` timing sync; `blind-to-x/pipeline/cost_db.py` / `dedup.py` bare-except; (c) T-251 Supabase DB password reset (user-owned blocker) |

| Work | **Project QC refresh and dirty-boundary proof**. Rehydrated live state, followed the auto-research selector, and refreshed stale project QC after concurrent project changes. Full `project_qc_runner.py --json` passed three times as HEAD moved and wrote canonical `.tmp/project_qc_runner_latest.json`: latest Blind-to-X `2682 passed, 9 skipped`, Shorts Maker V2 `1742 passed, 12 skipped`, Hanwoo `1475 passed`, Knowledge `69 passed`; lint/build/smoke gates passed where applicable. Final `product_readiness_score.py --json` reports overall score `95`, all project QC fresh, and Hanwoo still blocked by user-owned T-251 plus current dirty handoff. |
| Next Priorities | Handoff plan was regenerated for dirty signature `c586b1e16fd126c4d1f4617a3269a2af13111dc1a9c6639a90834190a7cb9a4c` and dirty paths `.ai/HANDOFF.md`, `.ai/SESSION_LOG.md`, `.ai/TASKS.md`, `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-06-15.md`, `nature-skills`, `projects/blind-to-x/tests/unit/test_daily_queue_floor.py`, `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/src/lib/actions/system.js`, and `projects/shorts-maker-v2/tests/unit/test_script_quality.py`. `debug_loop_inventory.py --fail-on-completion-blocked` exited `1` as expected proof of blockers: dirty handoff, stale code-review graph, T-251 Supabase reset, current-head GitHub Actions missing until explicit push/user push, and incomplete completion audit. No stage, commit, push, revert, live Prisma/T-251 retry, or `update_goal` was performed. |

| Work | **hanwoo-dashboard product quality uplift** (3 commits: 5bfa2e62, 4b004e6c, prior): (1) AnalysisTab market price comparison — grade distribution + recent 3 sales vs KAPE per-kg price, DashboardClient now passes `marketPrice` prop; (2) Fixed `record.auctionLocation` dead field ref in SalesTab (field never in schema), wrapped 4 DashboardClient mutation handlers (handleCreateEvent/handleToggleEvent/handleCreateSale/handleRecordFeed) with try-catch matching handleAddCattle pattern, updated source-grep tests; (3) Added `export const viewport` to layout.js (Next.js 14+ requirement, themeColor #3E2F1C/#1a1814, maximumScale 5 for accessibility). Tests: 541/541 all passing. |

Final sanity check observed concurrent workspace movement to head `34af7605` with staged files (`staged 58`) and selector now `candidate / project_qc_refresh`; this run did not perform staging, commit, push, revert, live Prisma/T-251 retry, cleanup apply, or `update_goal`. Completion audit remains `incomplete` (`5/15` complete, `10` blocked). Next safe step is to handle the current `project_qc_refresh` candidate or resolve the staged/dirty handoff boundary without disturbing unrelated staged work. |

> T-1570 relay note: `f3f376a6` is the verified code baseline before this documentation relay. After this relay is committed, use live `python execution/session_orient.py --json` for the exact current HEAD/ahead count; the remaining boundaries should still be publish/current-head Actions plus user-owned Hanwoo T-251.

> T-1404 verification note: staged code-review gate returned advisory WARN (`risk_score=0.35`) from test-gap heuristics, covered by focused source-browser tests, CLI preflight tests, live click-through evidence, and blind-to-x project QC.

## Notes

- **T-251 (active blocker)**: Supabase database password desynchronization. User must reset password via Supabase Dashboard (Project Settings > Database), then update `projects/hanwoo-dashboard/.env`.
- **Origin sync**: Use live `python execution/session_orient.py --json` before acting. Current relay state has `main` ahead of origin and a dirty worktree; do not push without explicit authorization.
- Older addenda archived in `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-05-15.md` and `.ai/archive/HANDOFF_archive_2026-05-19.md`.
